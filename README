Instructions                                                                                                                                                        
------------                                                                                                                                                        
1. Building the source code :                                                                                                                                       
----------------------------                                                                                                                                        
        1. uncompress the zip file to a destination location                                                                                                        
        2. make  
        3. Now you will have lamport_clock executable in your destination folder 
 
2. Running the package :
----------------------- 
        1. Once you have built the above source code, execute the below steps 
                terminal :: $chmod 777 lamport_clock                                                                                                                
                terminal :: $./lamport_clock                                                                                                                        
        2. You will be asked for the graph inputs. Do enter the same as per your graph
        3. Once you have entered all the inputs, allow the code to calculate the clocks for you for a second
        4. You will see a sequence of prints capturing the logical clocks for every site and its events as                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                    
                <site - "name"> : <event number "num"> : <"event type"> : <clock -"value">                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                    
        5. If you want additional logs, do enable DEBUG macro in the code and compile the code.
                 
3. Note          
---------           
        1. The code assumes, the causal order of messages are maintained. If not, it will end in a dead lock
        2. The send event waits for a reciever to be ready before sending the event
        3. The reciever unblocks the sender before getting blocked for reception
        4. The partner event index in the input section corresponds to the incident event index on the other site
 
        Eg: Send event from P1 to P3 from event number 1 in P1 to event number 3 in P3.
			Here partner_event_index = 3
